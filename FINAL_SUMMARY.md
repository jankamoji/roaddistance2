```python
if _HAS_CITIES_DB:
    try:
        city_info = get_nearest_city(slat, slon, max_distance=200)
        if city_info:
            out_rec["Nearest City (100k+)"] = city_info.get("name")
            dist_km, dur_min = get_route(site_origin, (city_info.get("lat"), city_info.get("lon")), route_cache=route_cache)
            out_rec["Distance to City (km)"] = round(dist_km, 1)
            out_rec["Time to City (min)"] = round(dur_min, 1)
    except Exception as e:
        log_rec["steps"].append({"error": f"Nearest City: {e}"})
```

### 4. Site Selection Export (15 lines)

    long_format_rows.append({
        "Destination": row.get("Nearest City (100k+)"),
        "Destination group": "Nearest City (100k+)",
        "Distance (km)": row.get("Distance to City (km)"),
        "Time (min)": row.get("Time to City (min)"),
        "Accessibility": 4,
        ...
    })
```

## ✅ Verification Results

```
1. Syntax Check
   ✅ app.py                    - Valid Python syntax

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Place Files Together
```
your_project/
├── app.py
└── eu_cities_db.py
```

### Step 2: Run App

streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 3: Use Normally
- Upload data as usual
- Click "Run Analysis"
- Results include 3 new columns:
  - `Nearest City (100k+)` → City name
  - `Distance to City (km)` → Route distance
  - `Time to City (min)` → Drive time

## 📊 New Results Columns

- ✅ Graceful fallback if module missing
- ✅ Uses existing OSRM routing
- ✅ Results cached for performance
- ✅ Integrated with Site Selection Tool export
- ✅ All original features intact

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Distance Calculation Flow
```
1. User site (lat, lon)
   ↓
2. get_nearest_city() from eu_cities_db
   ↓
3. Haversine distance to all 279 cities
   ↓
4. Find nearest within 200km radius
   ↓
5. OSRM routing for actual route distance
   ↓
6. Results in 3 new columns
```
