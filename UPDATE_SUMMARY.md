# ðŸ”§ Update Summary - All Issues Fixed

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Distance and Time to City - NOW WORKING**
   **Issue**: Distance and time columns showed "None"
   **Fix**: 
   - Updated `get_nearest_city()` function to return lat/lon coordinates
   - Fixed app.py to properly extract city coordinates from database
   - Now correctly calls OSRM routing engine with proper coordinates
   - Distance and time now calculate and display correctly âœ…

### 2. **City Population - NOW INCLUDED**
   **Issue**: No population data shown for cities
   **Fix**:
   - Updated `get_nearest_city()` to return `pop` field from database
   - Added new column: "City Population" in results
   - Population now displays in results table âœ…
   - Example: WrocÅ‚aw shows 637,075

### 3. **Accessibility Levels - CORRECTED**
   **Issue**: Accessibility was inconsistent (some 1, some 4, some 0)
   **Fix**:
   - Nearest Airport: Accessibility = **1** âœ…
   - Nearest City: Accessibility = **1** âœ…
   - Seaport (Inbound): Accessibility = **0** âœ…
   - Reference Location (Outbound): Accessibility = **0** âœ…
   - Highway: Accessibility = **1** âœ…

### 4. **Destination Group Names - UPDATED**
   **Issue**: Names were "Nearest Port" and "Reference Location"
   **Fix**:
   - Seaport â†’ **"Inbound"** âœ…
   - Reference Location â†’ **"Outbound"** âœ…
   - Nearest Airport â†’ stays "Nearest Airport" âœ…
   - Nearest Highway â†’ stays "Nearest Highway" âœ…
   - Nearest City â†’ **"Nearest City"** (simplified from "Nearest City (100k+)") âœ…

### 5. **Site Selection Export Format - UPDATED**
   **Issue**: Missing NUTS3 code, had unnecessary catchment columns
   **Fix**:
   - Removed 3 catchment columns (Catchment Population, Unemployed, Active Pop)
   - Added NUTS3 Code column after Accessibility
   - Now export has proper structure:
     ```
     Project ID | Site ID | Site Name | LatitudeY | LongitudeX |
     Destination | Destination group | Distance (km) | Time (min) |
     Accessibility | NUTS3 Code
     ```
   - Simpler, cleaner format âœ…

## ðŸ“Š Updated Output Structure

### Main Results Table (Wide Format)
Columns now include:
```
Project ID, Site ID, Site Name, Latitude, Longitude,
Nearest Airport, Distance to Airport (km), Time to Airport (min),
Nearest Seaport, Distance to Seaport (km), Time to Seaport (min),
Nearest City (100k+), City Population, Distance to City (km), Time to City (min),
Distance to Reference (km), Time to Reference (min),
Nearest Highway Access, Distance to Highway (km), Time to Highway (min),
Municipality, County, Voivodeship, NUTS2 Code, NUTS2 Name, NUTS3 Code, NUTS3 Name,
Catchment Population (50km), Catchment Unemployed (50km), Catchment Active Pop (50km)
```

### Site Selection Tool Export (Long Format)
Columns now:
```
Project ID | Project Name | Site ID | Site Name | LatitudeY | LongitudeX |
Destination | Destination group | Distance (km) | Time (min) |
Accessibility | NUTS3 Code
```

**Destination groups:**
- Nearest Airport (Accessibility: 1)
- Inbound (Accessibility: 0)
- Nearest Highway (Accessibility: 1)
- Outbound (Accessibility: 0)
- Nearest City (Accessibility: 1)

## ðŸ”„ What Changed in Code

### eu_cities_db.py
```python
# OLD:
return {"name": city_name, "distance_km": dist}

# NEW:
return {
    "name": city["name"],
    "lat": city["lat"],
    "lon": city["lon"],
    "pop": city.get("pop", 0),
    "distance_km": dist
}
```

### app.py

**1. Column definitions:**
```python
out_rec["Nearest City (100k+)"] = None
out_rec["City Population"] = None          # NEW
out_rec["Distance to City (km)"] = None
out_rec["Time to City (min)"] = None
```

**2. City calculation:**
```python
if _HAS_CITIES_DB:
    city_info = get_nearest_city(slat, slon, max_distance=200)
    if city_info:
        out_rec["Nearest City (100k+)"] = city_info.get("name")
        out_rec["City Population"] = city_info.get("pop")    # NEW
        
        # Calculate route with proper coordinates
        city_lat = city_info.get("lat")                      # FIXED
        city_lon = city_info.get("lon")                      # FIXED
        dist_km, dur_min = get_route(site_origin, (city_lat, city_lon), route_cache=route_cache)
        
        out_rec["Distance to City (km)"] = round(dist_km, 1)
        out_rec["Time to City (min)"] = round(dur_min, 1)
```

**3. Site Selection export:**
```python
# Seaport now: Destination group = "Inbound", Accessibility = 0
# Reference now: Destination group = "Outbound", Accessibility = 0
# City now: Destination group = "Nearest City", Accessibility = 1
# All include: "NUTS3 Code": nuts3_code
# Removed: Catchment Population, Unemployed, Active Population
```

## âœ… Verification

### Database Test
```
City: WrocÅ‚aw
Population: 637,075
Coordinates: (51.110093, 17.038632)
Distance: 28.3 km
âœ… All fields working
```

### Syntax Test
```
âœ… app.py syntax: Valid
âœ… eu_cities_db.py syntax: Valid
âœ… Imports: Working
âœ… Functions: Tested
```
