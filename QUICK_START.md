# Quick Setup Guide - Road Distance Finder v2.0

## 📦 What You Have

Two files that work together:
1. **app.py** - Main Streamlit application (1,725 lines)
2. **eu_cities_db.py** - EU cities database (370+ lines)

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Place Files Together
```
my_app_folder/
├── app.py
└── eu_cities_db.py
```

### Step 2: Run the App
```bash
cd my_app_folder
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 3: Use Normally
- Download templates
- Upload data (Sites, Airports, Seaports)
- Click "Run Analysis"
- Results now include nearest city (100k+)!

## ✅ Verification

### Test 1: Can Python find the module?
```bash
python -c "from eu_cities_db import get_nearest_city; print('✅ Import works!')"
```

### Test 2: Does city lookup work?
```bash
python -c "from eu_cities_db import get_nearest_city; result = get_nearest_city(52.23, 21.01); print(f'✅ Nearest city: {result}')"
# Expected: {'name': 'Warsaw', 'distance_km': ...}
```

### Test 3: Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 What's New

### New Columns in Results
```
- Nearest City (100k+)      ← City name (e.g., "Warsaw")
- Distance to City (km)     ← Route distance via OSRM
- Time to City (min)        ← Estimated drive time
```

### New Export Group
In "Site Selection Tool" export format, cities appear as:
```
Destination group: "Nearest City (100k+)"
Accessibility: 4
```

## 🔍 Database Coverage

**All 27 EU Countries:**
- Germany (DE): 37 cities
- Poland (PL): 28 cities
- France (FR): 32 cities

- Spain (ES): 29 cities
- Netherlands (NL): 28 cities
- Plus 21 more countries

**Total: 320+ cities (100k+ population)**

## 🎓 How It Works

```
User site coordinates (lat, lon)
    ↓
eu_cities_db.get_nearest_city()
    ↓
Search 320+ EU cities
    ↓
Find nearest within 200km (Haversine)
    ↓
Return city name and distance
    ↓
app.py calls OSRM for actual route distance
    ↓
Results in table:
  - Nearest City: Warsaw
  - Distance: 142.8 km
  - Time: 150 min
```

## 📋 Requirements

Same as original app:
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- requests
- streamlit
- streamlit-folium (optional, for map)
- folium (optional, for map)
- shapely (optional, for admin/NUTS)

No additional packages needed for cities database!

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if eu_cities_db.py is missing?**
A: App will still work, just skip the nearest city feature

**Q: Can I update the cities list?**
A: Yes! Edit eu_cities_db.py anytime, no need to touch app.py

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Yes for city lookup. OSRM routing needs internet for actual route distance

**Q: How accurate are distances?**
A: Same as before - OSRM routing engine accuracy

**Q: Can I add my own cities?**
A: Yes, just add to eu_cities_db.py dictionary

**Q: Is there any speed impact?**
A: Minimal - city lookup <50ms, routes cached

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Single Server
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY app.py eu_cities_db.py .
RUN pip install pandas numpy requests streamlit folium streamlit-folium shapely
EXPOSE 8501
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]
```

### Cloud (Streamlit Cloud)
1. Push both files to GitHub
2. Deploy from Streamlit Cloud
3. Both files automatically included

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Place both files in your project folder
2. Run `streamlit run app.py`
3. Test with sample data
4. Upload your real data
5. Enjoy nearest city feature!
